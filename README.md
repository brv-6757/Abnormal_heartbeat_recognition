## 📊 Dataset
This dataset consolidates heartbeat signals from the renowned MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset. With a substantial sample size, it serves as a foundation for training advanced neural networks.
- **File Name:** `ptbdb_normal.csv`, `ptbdb_abnormal.csv`
- **Description:** The datasets contain ECG recordings representing heart rhythms. The former encapsulates normal heartbeats, while the latter captures abnormal rhythms, offering a comprehensive view of cardiac activity variations.

## ⚙️ Training the Model:
### 1. Data Pre-processing:
- Load normal and abnormal datasets.
- Drop the target columns to obtain pure data samples.
- Split the normal dataset into training and testing sets.
### 2. Model Training & Evaluation:
- Train the autoencoder model using different loss functions.
- Determine a threshold value for classification based on the 95th percentile of the reconstruction error on training data.
- Evaluate model performance on combined validation data (normal + anomaly).
- Visualize the reconstructed ECG signals for both normal and anomaly samples.
### 3. Best Model Selection:
- Select the best model based on the minimum average validation error.
### 4. Classification & Metrics Calculation:
- Classify reconstruction errors as either normal or anomaly.
- Calculate and display performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and display the confusion matrix.

## 📈 Key Findings
* The model achieved an accuracy of 98.66% in classifying ECG rhythms.
* A recall of 100.00% means the model correctly identified all actual positives.
* The F1 Score, a measure of the model's accuracy considering both precision and recall, stands at 99.82%.
These metrics reflect the model's capability in ECG anomaly detection.
