## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository demonstrates the real time deployment of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based Autoencoders to perform anomaly detection on Electrocardiogram (ECG) data and send alerts in case of abnormality detected. Live ECG samples of heart rhythms are differentiated between normal and abnormal based on the reconstruction error. Model is implemented on Raspberry Pi and the ECG signal Aquisition is done by AD8232 integrated with ESP32.
